# How to access the status of the repo

Since GitHub Actions doesn't have an API yet, you can use the following
POSIX-compliant shell script to access the status of this repository.

```shell script
#!/bin/sh

# This script checks if the prisma e2e test workflow passes
# Check the end of the file for usage

check() {
	str=$(curl -s "https://github.com/$1/workflows/$2/badge.svg")

	case "$str" in
		*"passing"*)
			echo "no status, waiting..."
			sleep 10
			check $1 $2
			return
			;;
	esac

	case "$str" in
		*passing*)
			echo "success"
			exit 0
			;;
	esac

	echo "fail"
	exit 1
}

# Syntax:
# check <repo slug> <workflow name>
check "prisma/prisma-e2e-tests" "test"

```
