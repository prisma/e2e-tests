# MongoDB at Azure CosmosDB Emulator

Prisma Client with MongoDB at Azure CosmosDB, using the [local emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=ssl-netstd21).

⚠️ Note that [support for Azure Cosmos DB is spotty in Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/11921) and only works in very limited cases (like the minimal tests that are run here)
