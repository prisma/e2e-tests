# MongoDB at Azure CosmosDB

Prisma Client with MongoDB at Azure CosmosDB.

⚠️ Note that [support for Azure Cosmos DB is spotty in Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/11921) and only works in very limited cases (like the minimal tests that are run here).

## How to run this locally

### Environment Variables

Set the env var (`DATABASE_URL_DB_MONGODB_AZURE_COSMOSDB`). The data should match the snapshot.
